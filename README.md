# iNiLabs PHP Intern Assignment

Welcome to the iNiLabs PHP Intern Assignment repository! This repository contains my solutions to the coding assignments provided by iNiLabs for the PHP Intern position. I have chosen to work on Task 1, Task 4, and Task 5.

## Task 1: Class Inheritance

In the `task-1` folder, you will find the implementation of geometric shape classes, including Circle and Rectangle. Each shape class inherits from a common base class, providing methods for calculating the area of the respective shape. This assignment demonstrates my understanding of class inheritance and basic object-oriented programming concepts.

## Task 4: Polymorphism

The `task-4` folder contains a set of animal classes showcasing polymorphism. Each animal class overrides the `makeSound` method, providing a unique sound for each animal. This demonstrates my grasp of polymorphic behavior, where different objects can respond differently to the same method.

## Task 5: To-Do Module (Mandatory)

For the mandatory Task 5, I have developed a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and followed TTD approach To-Do module using the Laravel Framework. The backend of the module handles the CRUD operations, while the frontend is rendered using the Blade template engine for those who are not familiar with VueJs. However, I used blade template.

### Features of the To-Do Module

- **Create**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Read**: Users can view their list of tasks.
- **Update**: Users can mark tasks as completed or edit task details.
- **Delete**: Users can remove tasks from the list.

## How to Run

To run and test the implementations, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/mdalifkhanrifat/php-intern-assignment.git`
2. Navigate to each task folder using your preferred terminal or command prompt.
3. Refer to the README files in individual task folders for specific instructions on running and testing each task.
